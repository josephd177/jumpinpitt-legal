    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p class="intro">JumpIn Pitt ("we," "us," or "our") operates the JumpIn Pitt mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Phone number (used to create and authenticate your account)</li>
        <li>Full name (entered during profile setup)</li>
        <li>Profile photo (optional, if you choose to upload one)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Location data (used for nearby venue discovery and proximity check-ins — only while the App is in use)</li>
        <li>Check-in records (which venues you have visited and when)</li>
        <li>Saved venues (stored locally on your device via AsyncStorage)</li>
        <li>Search history (stored locally on your device)</li>
        <li>Device push notification token (if you grant notification permission)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authenticate your account via phone number verification</li>
        <li>Enable proximity-based check-ins (300-foot geofence)</li>
        <li>Display your Pittsburgh Passport progress and explorer level</li>
        <li>Power the check-in leaderboard (using your full name)</li>
        <li>Send push notifications about deals and events (if you opt in)</li>
        <li>Improve and maintain the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
    <p>We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Supabase (our backend database and authentication provider) — see supabase.com/privacy</li>
        <li>Expo (push notification delivery) — see expo.dev/privacy</li>
        <li>Apple (required for iOS distribution and push notification routing)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your full name may be visible to other users on the check-in leaderboard. Your phone number is never visible to other users.</p>

    <h2>4. Location Data</h2>
    <p>We access your location only while the App is in use ("When In Use" permission). We do not track your location in the background. Location data is used in real time to detect proximity to venues and is not stored on our servers beyond what is needed to record a check-in event.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your account data (name, phone, check-in records) is stored securely on Supabase infrastructure with row-level security policies that prevent other users from accessing your data. Profile photos are stored in Supabase Storage. We implement reasonable technical safeguards, but no system is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete your personal information from our systems within a reasonable time, except where retention is required by law.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can revoke location permission in your device Settings at any time (this disables check-ins)</li>
        <li>You can revoke notification permission in your device Settings at any time</li>
        <li>You can request deletion of your account and associated data by emailing <a href="mailto:support@jumpinpitt.com">support@jumpinpitt.com</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>If you grant notification permission, we may send you push notifications about new venue deals, events, or app updates. You can opt out at any time by disabling notifications in your device Settings.</p>

    <h2>10. SMS Messaging</h2>
    <p>When you sign up or log in, you consent to receive a one-time SMS verification code to authenticate your account. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency: 1 per login. Reply STOP to opt out or HELP for support.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes through the App. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Any disputes shall be resolved in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or want to request deletion of your data, contact us at:</p>
