    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>

    <h2>1. Agreement Overview</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Agreement") govern your use of the JumpIn Pitt mobile application ("App") operated by
        JumpIn Pitt ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by this
        Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>
    <p>We may update this Agreement at any time. Material changes will be communicated through the App. Continued use
        after changes constitutes your acceptance.</p>

    <h2>2. License</h2>
    <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on
        your personal device for personal, non-commercial purposes only. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. By using the App, you represent that you meet this requirement.
        If you are under 18, you represent that a parent or guardian has reviewed and agreed to these terms on your
        behalf.</p>

    <h2>4. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>You must provide a valid US phone number to create an account. You are responsible for all activities that occur
        under your account. You may not share your account or allow others to access it. Notify us immediately at <a
            href="mailto:support@jumpinpitt.com">support@jumpinpitt.com</a> if you suspect unauthorized use.</p>

    <h2>5. SMS Messaging Consent</h2>
    <p>By creating an account, you consent to receive a one-time SMS verification code to authenticate your account.
        Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency: 1 per login attempt. Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to opt out
        or <strong>HELP</strong> for support. SMS consent is not a condition of purchase. See our <a
            href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2>6. Location Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses your device's location to enable venue discovery and proximity-based check-ins (within 300 feet of a
        venue). You can revoke location permission in your device settings at any time, but check-in features will be
        disabled.</p>

    <h2>7. Check-Ins and Passport Stamps</h2>
    <p>Passport stamps are awarded for personal tracking purposes only and have no monetary value. We reserve the right
        to modify or remove check-in records in cases of suspected abuse or system error.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App is licensed, not sold. We retain all right, title, and interest in the App, its content, design,
        software, and all related intellectual property. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, modify, or create
        derivative works without our express written permission.</p>
    <p>Any feedback or suggestions you provide may be used by us without restriction or compensation.</p>

    <h2>9. Venue &amp; Menu Information</h2>
    <p>We strive to keep venue information accurate but make no representations about the completeness or reliability of
        any venue data (hours, deals, addresses, menus, dietary labels, or nutritional information). Menu items and
        dietary tags are provided by partner venues and have not been independently verified by JumpIn Pitt. If you have
        food allergies or dietary restrictions, always confirm directly with the venue. Venue information may change
        without notice.</p>

    <h2>10. Lawful Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws in connection with your use of the App.
        You may not use the App in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations.</p>

    <h2>11. Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p>You may not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the App for any commercial purpose</li>
        <li>Scrape, crawl, or copy App content by automated means</li>
        <li>Sell, sublicense, lease, or transfer your access rights</li>
        <li>Circumvent or interfere with security features</li>
        <li>Impersonate another person or provide false information</li>
        <li>Use the App to transmit spam or unsolicited communications</li>
        <li>Publish benchmarking or comparative results without consent</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Third-Party Components</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services (such as mapping, authentication, and data storage). Your use of those
        services is subject to their respective terms. In case of conflict, third-party license terms prevail for their
        respective components.</p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for violation of this Agreement or for any other reason at
        our sole discretion. Upon termination, your license to use the App expires immediately. Sections 8, 14, 15, 16,
        and 17 survive termination.</p>

    <h2>14. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
    <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES
        INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
    <p>WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE, CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE, OR THAT RESULTS OBTAINED FROM USE OF
        THE APP WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND ANY VENUE OR THIRD
        PARTY.</p>

    <h2>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, JUMPIN PITT AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, OR BUSINESS
        INTERRUPTION, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP.</p>
    <p>OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS YOU
        PAID TO US IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless JumpIn Pitt and its affiliates from and against any claims,
        damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from: (a) your use of the App; (b)
        your violation of this Agreement; (c) your violation of any third-party right; or (d) any content you submit
        through the App.</p>

    <h2>17. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to its conflict of law
        provisions. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Allegheny
        County, Pennsylvania.</p>

    <h2>18. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and JumpIn Pitt regarding the App. If any provision
        is found unenforceable, it will be reformed to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will
        continue in full force. Our failure to enforce any right does not constitute a waiver. You may not assign your
        rights under this Agreement without our written consent.</p>
